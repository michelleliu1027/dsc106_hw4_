                <p class="Interpretations">By looking at the line chart of monthly total sales of 
                    those 5 products at the 5 locations you provided, what we find first is that, 
                    in general, from 2016 to 2019, North East region is where our products are consumed 
                    by customers the most while the Central region is where our products are least 
                    consumed by customers. Therefore, in order to expand our profits, 
                    we should devote our energies more into the North East region to win more favors 
                    from them. 
                    <br>
                    <br> Also, one alerting thing from the above plot is that, 
                    in all those locations, after October 2018 which is exactly the time 
                    when Burger King introduced the Impossible Burger, the sales of our products 
                    seems to decrease in an immediate speed but not lasting. 
                    To justify this kind of view, let's see another graph.

        <div class = "texts">
                <p class="Interpretations">The bar chart above indicates that after the 
                    introduction of Impossible Burger from Burger King (Oct 2018), 
                    the sales of McDonald in all 5 regions occurred a shocking decrement.
                     However, such decrement did not last for a long time: 
                     in the later months (Nov 2018 â€” Sep 2019), we can see that the sales 
                     varied a little bit. Therefore, we can conclude that the influences
                      brought by the Impossible Burger would, in fact, threatened the 
                      profits of McDonald at the very start. However, such competition 
                      will not cause McDonald always in an adversary position. 
                      
                    <br>
                    <br> One lesson from those sales data is that, it would be good for 
                    McDonald to come up with innovations to boost the sales from 
                    customers when other competitors provide some new strategies in marketing. 
                    But McDonald should also not be too panic since the negative effects 
                    brought by competitors will not last for too long. The market will 
                    finally balance the trends in customers about chasing for something 
                    innovative.

            <p class="Interpretations">By exploring the average sales from Jan 2016 to Sep 2019, 
                we also find that North East Region contributed to our sales the most. 
                But, overall, all 5 locations were almost the same in contributions 
                to the sales of our products. So, we might put our energies the most 
                in North East region but still pay attentions to the remaining 4 
                regions.

            <b>Hambugers are consumed the most, Chicken Fillet the second 
            and Fish Fillet the last.</b> Therefore, I suggest McDonald to 
            invest more on hamburgers since this is the product being 
            loved most by customers. 

            <br><br>Also, those data told us that in North East region,

            But, since the consumption behaviors are similar in those 5 regions,
